# Mastermind

A project created for the purpose of our uni AI subject.

##  Background

Based on the  [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29) board game. We've implemented a few different alorithms which can resolve the game. The main goal was to compare them and find the most optimal solution. There is also a dedicated GUI to show the effects  of our job.

## Algorithms
 1. Brute force
  1. Dummy (each combination respectively)
  1. Random (combinations in randomized order without repetitions)
2. Smart random (Random with rejecting impossible combinations)
3. Knuth (also known as five-guess algorithm)
4. Genetic

## Stack

 - Python3
 - PyGame
